# World Settings

Deploying your Cortana skill to **World** will submit your skill for review. Once it has passed review, your skill will be published in all markets that you specified when you registered your bot.

>[!TIP]
> If you complete some of the required fields but need to continue later, click on the `Save and Close` button at the bottom of the page. This will save the data you've already entered, and allow you to resume later.

For more information about the requirements for publishing to **World**, visit the [Cortana skills Kit Certification Requirements](./skill-review-guidelines.md) page.

    Complete the required fields that are marked with an asterisk (`*`).

If the team has any concerns or questions during the review process, you will receive an email message at the address you specified. If it's rejected, then the details and reasons for rejection are provided. If all requirements are met, then your Cortana skill is accepted and deployed.
