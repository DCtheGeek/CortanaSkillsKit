# Test Group Settings

Deploying to **Test Group** makes your Cortana skill available to a group of users that you specify, using individual MSA email addresses. Typically, you create a test group to have others test your Cortana skill and provide feedback. It's a really good idea to test and update your skill before making it generally available.

1. On the **Configure Cortana** page, under the **Test Group Settings** section, enter the following information.

    Complete the required fields that are marked with an asterisk (*).

    1. **Skill information** section

        * `Display name`: The length of the name is limited to 30 characters.
        * `Invocation name`: This field displays the name that the user speaks (or types) to invoke your skill.

            >
            > When an MSA user clicks on the **Group Access URL** in the message, they have the option to accept or decline joining the skill test group. If the user accepts, then access is granted to test your Cortana skill. If the user declines to join, then access is denied.
